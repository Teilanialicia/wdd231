      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>To showcase high-paying psychology careers through an accessible and professional website design.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>Students and professionals interested in pursuing careers in psychology, seeking information on lucrative opportunities.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Scenarios</h2>
      <p>The following scenarios are based on common questions our target audience may ask when visiting the website. These questions help guide the content and user experience:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scenario 1: A prospective psychology graduate student looking for program options:</strong>
          <p><em>Question:</em> "What are the best graduate programs in psychology for someone with an undergraduate degree in a different field?"</p>
          <p><em>Answer:</em> The website will offer a comprehensive guide to psychology graduate programs, including information about MAPR (Master of Arts in Psychological Research) and other programs designed for non-psychology undergraduates. It will highlight the application process, prerequisites, and opportunities for transitioning into clinical or research-focused psychology careers.</p>
        </li>
    
        <li>
          <strong>Scenario 2: A potential client seeking therapy services from a licensed psychologist:</strong>
          <p><em>Question:</em> "How do I find a qualified therapist who can help with childhood trauma?"</p>
          <p><em>Answer:</em> The website will provide a directory of licensed therapists specializing in trauma recovery. It will also feature helpful articles on what to expect from therapy, types of trauma therapy (e.g., CBT, EMDR), and tips on selecting a therapist who fits the client's needs and preferences.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <section>
      <h2>Color Palette</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Primary – Oxford Blue (#0A1E33):</strong>  
          Used for headings, navigation bar background, and primary buttons. This deep blue anchors the site and provides strong contrast.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Accent – Sky Blue (#BCD3F2):</strong>  
          Used for link hover effects, button highlights, and section dividers. It draws attention gently without overwhelming.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background – Sage (#D4CB92):</strong>  
          Applied as the main background color of the page for a calm, earthy tone that complements the content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Background Accent – Apricot (#FFFFFF):</strong>  
          Used for content boxes and cards to give a clean and readable contrast against the sage background.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Highlight – Columbia Blue (#80A4ED):</strong>  
          Used sparingly for callouts, selected states (e.g., active navigation), or small icons to add visual interest.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Typography</h2>
      <p>The site will use a clean, sans-serif font stack to maintain readability and accessibility across all screen sizes and devices. A maximum of three fonts are used, as outlined below:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Verdana:</strong>  
          Used for body paragraphs and general content. Verdana is highly readable on screens due to its wide letter spacing and simple structure.
          <p style="font-family: Verdana;">This is a sample paragraph using the Verdana font.</p>
        </li>
    
        <li>
          <strong>Geneva:</strong>  
          Used for subheadings and sidebar elements. Geneva has a clean, modern look that pairs well with Verdana without competing with it.
          <p style="font-family: Geneva;">This is a sample paragraph using the Geneva font.</p>
        </li>
    
        <li>
          <strong>Tahoma:</strong>  
          Used for navigation menus and button text. Tahoma is compact and efficient, making it ideal for UI elements.
          <p style="font-family: Tahoma;">This is a sample paragraph using the Tahoma font.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    
      <p>These fonts are chosen for their clarity and professional appearance, ensuring the site remains easy to read and navigate for all users.</p>
