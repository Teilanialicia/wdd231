      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>This website is a final project for my web development class — but it’s also something much more personal. I’m using it to organize my research and thoughts as I prepare to apply to psychology graduate programs.
      <br><br>
      With ADHD, anxiety, and a deep love of psychology, I wanted a space where I could break everything down visually and calmly. This planner is for me — and maybe for others like me who are navigating similar questions.

      <h2>My Goal</h2>
      <p>I’m especially interested in becoming a <strong>clinical psychologist</strong> who can do both therapy and assessments. I want to understand what the path looks like — especially since I’m coming from a non-psych undergrad background.
